## Bot Goals
Development of a data crawler script to colect and mine League of Legends database from https://lol.fandom.com/

- Includes all general matches from all global leagues and it's informations - such as winners and losers, picks and bans, players, match length, gold, damage and lots of minor data.

- My future goals are to implement data mining to minor leagues and special events - such as MSI and Worlds. Also, I want to colect data from players, teams and Riot Games.
